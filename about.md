St. Xavier’s College, Kathmandu Alumni Committee connects the Alumni with the college and spreads their goodwill to the society and eventually the country. It is a bonded circle of all of its alums united together to protect the institution’s motto of “Dedicated to Leadership, Excellence and Service”. We have been organizing various activities and collaborating with various other institutes in aiding what can be done to live up to the Xavierian spirit of excellence, leadership and service.
The purpose of the St. Xavier’s Alumni Association is to provide an organization to serve and to promote the mutual interests of St. Xavier’s College and its alumni through and in collaboration with various national and international entities. We expect this association to play an important role in helping to shape the future of our college by representing the views of its members and contributing to building an engaged and supportive alumni community appropriate to a reputed institution.
